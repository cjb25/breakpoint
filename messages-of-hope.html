<h1>Welcome to the Wall of <strong>Hope</strong></h1>
<p>
  This is a sacred, evolving space where survivor mothers' can share their stories, tributes, photos, or moments of healing and remembrance.
  Here, hope lives in every post — whether it’s a birthday tribute, a quiet memory, a picture from a joyful day, or an acknowledgment of a difficult anniversary.
</p>
<p>
  The word Hope is the root of this wall — Hope for healing. Hope for connection. Hope that even in pain, there’s evidence of love.

      She shouted,“mommy'. They said she wouldn't know me, but she ran to me."Mommy, when can I go home to live with you?" I cry inside, holding onto the memory of this precious moment.
