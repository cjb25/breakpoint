                <h2>Purpose & Mission</h2>
     
      <p><span class="title">Breakpo!nt</span> is a peer-created interactive healing platform designed to empower survivor Mothers - particularly those who have lost their child(ren) for any reason, including but not limited to: adoption, abortion, or termintation of parental rights.<br>
        <br> This is a safe place to privately process emotions, reclaim your identity, cherish you childs memories and rebuild life after profound loss.
<h3>You Are Not Expected to Just Move On.</h3>
<p>Together, We Move Through and With Our Pain.</p>

        <h2>Why "<span class="title">Breakpo!nt</span>?" </h2>
        <p>A '<span class=title>Break!point</span>' is an intentional pause - a moment to confront the past and understand its impact before moving forward to rewrite the next chapter.<br>
          <br>
          Mothers who are surviving trafficking, abuse, complex-traumas and the loss of a child often lack safe places to process their grief without additional barriers to support. Here, you are reminded you have options, and given the freedom to heal on your own terms.</p><br>
          <p>We will face a <span class="title">Breakpo!nt</span> everyday - for the entirety of our lives.</p>
          <h3><strong>Your Pain Is Real.</strong><br>
          <strong>You Are Not Alone.</strong><br></h3>
