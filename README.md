BreakPo!nt Project

*A Safe Space for Survivor Mothers*

This project is dedicated to creating a supportive envirnoment for survivor mothers who have experienced the devestating loss of their children. It is intended to be a space where these mothers can connect, share their stories, and have agency over what their healing journey will look like. 

🚧 Work In Progress 🚧

This project is still under active development, and there are many bugs to be worked through adn accessibility challenges to be solved. Please note that it's a continuous learning journey for me, and I am committed to improving it over time. 

🌱 A Personal Journey

While this project is still in its early stages, it means the world to me. It's more than just code; it's a manifestation of healing, growth, strength, and solidarity. It's a sacred space built with care, passion, and the hope of offering comfort and support to those who need it the most. 

⚙️ Future Plans: 

- Bug Fixes: Ongoing Improvements and fixes to enhance functionality and user experience
- Features: Adding tools and resources for grieving mothers in need of support
- Community Building: Creating opportunity for survivor mothers to engage

Thank you for being a part of this journey with me 💜
